# Introduction

## **1.What is python?**

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It supports multiple programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python has a large standard library and strong community support, which makes it popular for applications such as data analysis, machine learning, web development, automation, and scripting.

## 🧠 If the interviewer asks for more details, you can add:

Developed by: Guido van Rossum in 1991.

### **Key Features:**

Easy syntax and readability

Cross-platform compatibility

Large standard library and third-party packages

Open-source and dynamically typed

Strong community support

## 🗣️ Short & Crisp

Python is a high-level, open-source, and interpreted language used for data science, AI, web development, and automation. It’s popular because it’s easy to learn and has a huge library ecosystem.

## **2.Why Python**

Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
